# Testing-PyGame

Game that was made to test PyGames game development.

In this game Player could control two Main Characters: Dora and Finn. WASD are used to control Dora, and arrows to conotrol Finn.
At first, Main Characters appear on different squares, and then Player could control their movements freely, with one exception, characters cant move out of the game screen.
